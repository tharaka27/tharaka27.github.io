Hi! I’m Tharaka, an incoming Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne, Australia in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/). I’m interested in exploring the interesection of human computer interaction and robotics, human robot interaction as a therapeutical intervention scheme for ADHD, ASD and CP.


## My Research and Experience 

I received my B.Sc from the [Department of Computer Science, University of Moratuwa](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/) specializing in [Integrated Computer Engineering](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/programs/ICE). My area of specialization during undergraduate studies was embedded systems particularly PCB design and FPGA/GPU kernel development. 

I completed my industrial internship at the [Hardware Accelerated Systems](https://arteculate.asia/lseg-tech-talks-pre-event-gpu-machine-learning/) team at [LSEG Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lsegtechnology/) under Thayaparan Sripavan and Janaka Perera, where I delved into cutting-edge projects involving Data center GPU and FPGA cards. I also completed a short-term (3 months) research internship under [Dr. Anusha Withana](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/anusha-withana.html) at (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Sydney)[https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html]. My time at the University of Sydney's Department of Computer Science and Engineering further honed my skills, particularly in Human-Computer Interface technology.

After graduation I joined [Zerobeta Inc.](https://www.zerobeta.xyz/) as a Software Engineer. During this time I was interested in robotics and wanted a career change. So I joined [Institute of Computer Science, University of Applied Science Zurich, Switzerland](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/) as Research Assistant in Robotics under [A/Prof. Giovanni Toffetti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T1oURHYAAAAJ).
